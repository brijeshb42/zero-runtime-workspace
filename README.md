1. Make sure pnpm is installed and available globally. See [installation](https://pnpm.io/installation).
2. Run `pnpm install` in the cloned repo directory to install all dependencies.
3. In one terminal, run `pnpm watch` to build and watch the packages
4. In another terminal, run `pnpm start` to start the vite app. The localhost url to open will be logged in terminal.
5. To build the packages, run `pnpm build`. To build the app, run `pnpm build:app`
6. You can preview the built app by running `pnpm preview` and open the logged URL in console.
7. At any point, you can directly run `pnpm preview`. It'll automatically run the build commands if not already built.
